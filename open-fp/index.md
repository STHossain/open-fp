The Open Forecasting Project is a long-term research project and provides a platform for sharing economic forecasts. The aim is to create a panel data set of macroeconomic forecasts that is both easy to use and employs recent findings of forecasting literate. 

You are welcome to participate in our project by handing in your own predictions. Currently, we collect forecasts for GDP-growth, inflation and unemployment rate in the euro area and the US. However, we are willing to gather forecasts for other countries or currency areas if there is interest in submitting them.

As the project goes on, we will visualize our panel data through interactive graphs, comparing your forecasts to the predictions of the Survey of Professional Forecasters as a benchmark.

Happy forecasting!

## What do we want to achieve? 

Some text in which I cite an author.[^fn1]

As laid out by Patton (2015)[^fn2], forecast surveys should specify the loss function of interest. This is not done by either the SPF of the Federal Reserve or the SPF of the ECB. We want to address this issue by letting the forecaster hand in the loss function they considered.

Research questions at hand:

* Are the results of Clements (2012)[^fn4] driven by the definition of large bins in the SPF forecasts?

What is this? Yet *another* citation?[^fn3]
