The Open Forecasting Project (Open-FP) is a long-term research project and provides a platform for sharing economic forecasts. The aim is to create a panel data set of macroeconomic forecasts that is both easy to use and employs recent findings of forecasting literature. 

You are welcome to participate in our project by handing in your own predictions. Currently, we collect forecasts for GDP-growth, inflation and unemployment rate in the euro area and the US. However, we are willing to gather forecasts for other countries or currency areas if you are interested in submitting them.

As the project goes on, we will visualize our panel data through interactive graphs, comparing your forecasts with the predictions of the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)[^fn1] [^SPF-US] as a benchmark. In order to provide the ranking, we formed [a panel data set](/data/) that contains all forecasts from both SPFs and the Open-FP that gets updated with each survey round.

Happy forecasting!

## What do we want to achieve? 

As laid out by Patton (2015)[^fn2], forecast surveys should specify the loss function of interest. This is not done by either the SPF of the Federal Reserve nor the SPF of the ECB. We want to address this issue by prescribing the mean squared error and the continuous ranked probability score as evaluation criteria.

Research questions at hand:

* Are the results of Clements (2012)[^fn4] driven by the definition of large bins in the SPF forecasts?
* How can we promote communicating uncertainty in macroeconomic predictions.
